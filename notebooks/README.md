# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the NanoBoost methodology.

## Contents

Notebooks are organized to guide users through:

1. **Data preprocessing** - Loading and preparing nanopore data
2. **Feature extraction** - Applying wavelet transforms and extracting features
3. **Model training** - Building and training the NanoBoost model
4. **Evaluation** - Analyzing model performance and generating results

## Usage

To run the notebooks:

```bash
# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

Then navigate to the desired notebook in your browser.

## Note

Notebooks should be run in sequence for best results, as later notebooks may depend on outputs from earlier ones.
